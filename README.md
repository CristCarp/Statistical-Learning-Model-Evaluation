# Evaluation of Statistical Learning and Machine Learning Models

## Overview
This repository contains my Master's thesis focused on the evaluation of statistical learning and machine learning models through the bias–variance tradeoff.

The objective of this work is to analyze how variable selection and regularization methods behave under different data-generating processes, with a particular focus on overfitting, underfitting, and model instability.

## Methods Studied
- Forward, Backward and Stepwise Selection
- LASSO
- Elastic Net
- LARS

## Methodology
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Evaluation through exact recovery, overfitting and underfitting probabilities
- Empirical application on multicollinear data

## Repository Structure
- The `Master's thesis.pdf` - a PDF version of the study itself
- `Simulations.sas` - Monte Carlo simulations code
- `Empirical application.sas` - Empirical application code

## Tools
- SAS (simulations and empirical application)
- LaTeX (manuscript)

## Academic Context
This work was carried out in an academic context as part of a Master's degree.
The study is written in English.
